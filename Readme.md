When you have many tracks in your mix it is very important to have option to control only selected track.
I never can understand the controllers of 8 tracks where you have to move the page left and right to change volume or solo some track which index is bigger than 8. So in fact it makes it useless for me.
So I decided to make my own controller which can control any currently selected track. And I did it ;)
Features:
- Control volume of selected track
- Arm/Disarm of selected track
- Mute/Unmute selected track
- Solo/Unsolo selected track
- Undo
- Redo
- Play
- Stop
- Record
- Move left
- Move right
- Change view
- Loop on/off

Each part of this project has own readme file.

Known issue: it will not work correctly when groups are folded. Because it will not count tracks inside the folder.
