I use Arduino Leonardo for this controller.
For building this project you need base skills like soldering, assembling etc. Also you need to have basic knowledge about Arduino its pins and how to write code for it.
I use BEHRINGER X32 (not motorised) fader because it is easy to buy.
You can see all connections on photos, it is very simple and straightforward if you know how buttons/pins must be implemented. For the fader I use analog input as well.
Also you need to use hot gun to glue some parts to make the device more solid.
